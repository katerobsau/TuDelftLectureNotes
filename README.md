TU Delft Lecture Notes

Slides are made using R ioslides and can be used with a standard html browser.

You can use the arrows to navigate.

Other display modes include the single character short cut keys:

'f': enable fullscreen mode

'w': toggle widescreen mode

'o': enable overview mode

'h': enable code highlight mode

'p': show presenter notes

Pressing Esc exits all of these modes. See the sections below on Code Highlighting and Presenter Mode for additional detail on those modes.
